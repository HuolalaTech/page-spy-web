One of the core capabilities of PageSpy is its service that connects the client and the debugging endpoint, and forwards messages between them.

To ensure data security and ease of use, PageSpy offers a variety of complete, out-of-the-box deployment options. You can choose any deployment method that suits yourself.

### Deploy Using Node#node

```bash
yarn global add @huolala-tech/page-spy-api@latest

# If you use npm

npm install -g @huolala-tech/page-spy-api@latest
```

After installation, run `page-spy-api` in the terminal to start the service. Watch the video to learn how to deploy PageSpy using Node:

### Deploy Using Docker#docker

```bash

```

### Next Steps#next

After deployment, you need to integrate the appropriate SDK into the client.

The SDK's role is to collect runtime information from the client application and automatically send the collected data to the deployed PageSpy service, which then forwards it to the debugging endpoint.
