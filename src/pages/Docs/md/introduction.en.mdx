### Introduction#introduction

<b>PageSpy</b> is a tool used for debugging projects on platforms sucs as Web / MiniProgram / HarmonyOS App. Based on encapsulation of native web APIs, it filters and transforms the parameters of native methods when called, and converts into messages with specific format for consumption by the debugger client. The debugger presents ui in an interactive devtools-like for easy viewing after receives the message data.

### When to use?#when-to-use

<u>
  *It's **PageSpy** show time whenever you can't debug code with local
  devtools!*
</u>
Let's see the following instances:

- **Debugging of H5 or webview app locally**: in the past, some products provided panels that could display information on H5, but the small screens of mobile devices make it inconvenient for operation, and the display is not user-friendly. Issues such as information being truncated are also common.
- **Remote work and cross-regional collaboration**: traditional communications such as emails, phone calls, and video conferences are inefficient, and fault information is not comprehensive, making it prone to misunderstandings and misjudgments.
- **White screen issues on user devices**: traditional approaches to troubleshooting, such as data monitoring and log analysis, depend on troubleshooters understanding business requirements and technical implementations.
