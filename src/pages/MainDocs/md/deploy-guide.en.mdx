### Main Components#main-components

PageSpy is composed of the following three modules:

- Debugging Client: Corresponds to the [HuolalaTech/page-spy-web](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/page-spy-web) repository. It is primarily used by developers and provides various debugging features, including online debugging and offline replay.
- SDK: Corresponds to the [HuolalaTech/page-spy](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/page-spy) repository. It is responsible for sending data generated during runtime from the user's project to the server, which then forwards it to the debugging client.
- Server: Corresponds to the [HuolalaTech/page-spy-api](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/page-spy-api) repository. It is mainly responsible for relaying messages between the two endpoints and storing data.

The interaction diagram between the three modules is as follows:
