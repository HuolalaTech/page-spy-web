### Relation of the O-Spy and PageSpy? #difference

O-Spy is built on top of the capabilities of [PageSpy](/) and its plugin ecosystem. Specifically, it packages the following three dependencies:

- `@huolala-tech/page-spy-browser`;
- `@huolala-tech/page-spy-plugin-rrweb`;
- `@huolala-tech/page-spy-plugin-data-harbor`;

The key differences between O-Spy and PageSpy are as follows:

|                            | O-Spy                      | PageSpy |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- |

### Where does the data recorded by O-Spy store? #where-data-stored

All data is stored locally on the user's device, and will not be uploaded to any third-party server.

The storage strategy: O-Spy stores data in an array in memory. When the volume of data in the array reaches a critical value, the data will be written to a temporary file. The critical value is 10M by default (click [here](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/page-spy/blob/main/packages/page-spy-plugin-data-harbor/src/harbor/blob.ts#L18) to view the source code). When the page is refreshed, all data will be destroyed.
